# Baseball Chip Schedule Service

This is the UI for baseball chip.

## Environment Variables

### For the UI

`REACT_APP_BASE_API_URL` - This is the base URL of the API, e.g. everything that comes before the endpoint. For running locally this would be `http://localhost:<port>`.

### For services that you'll need to stand up

#### Schedule service
`THE_ODDS_API_KEY` - your API key from [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/). If this isn't set, you can't use the `includeOdds` query parameter

## How to run

`npm run start` will stand this up by itself on port 3000 by default. But, you'll need to run the accompanying APIs as well, so consider using `docker-compose` to stand the services up as well.
